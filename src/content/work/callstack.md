At Callstack, Iâ€™ve been lucky to wear multiple hats ðŸŽ© 

Iâ€™m involved in an R&D initiative, where weâ€™re developing an AI framework that creates intelligent chatbots. 
These bots are fed with company data, helping employees navigate their daily tasks more efficiently ðŸ¤– 

Alongside this exciting project, I conduct audits of React Native applications, searching for issues and guiding 
teams on how to make their products behave better. 

It's a blend of innovation and improvement, which keeps things interesting ðŸš€
