At Bright Inventions, I expanded my expertise by diving into backend development and re-familiarizing myself with 
Angular after a few years away from it. I conducted numerous recruitment interviews, which gave me great insight 
into finding the right talent. Working with Nest.js, React, and Angular allowed me to balance both frontend and 
backend tasks. It was an exciting time, but I felt I was ready for something new and thrilling ðŸš€
