At e-Kiosk, I worked as a Frontend Engineer, focusing on developing and optimizing their React Native application ðŸ“±

I was responsible for rolling out new features, fixing bugs, and making sure the app ran smoothly. Some days felt 
like debugging a mystery novel, but in the end, the direct impact of my work on the user experience made it 
all worthwhile ðŸ§©
