I spent over two years at Airnauts, beginning as a Full Stack Developer and later transitioning to a React Architect role. 
As a Full Stack Developer, I built single-page applications using Angular, React, and Vue, while also developing 
backend services with .NET Core. My role involved more than just codingâ€”I mentored junior developers and conducted 
interviews to help build the team ðŸ”§

When I moved into the React Architect role, I focused on designing scalable systems and leading the team in establishing 
best practices for frontend architecture. My goal was to ensure our systems were not only functional but also built for 
longevity ðŸ’¡ 

The best compliment an architect can get? When everything runs so smoothly, no one notices 
the architecture at all.
