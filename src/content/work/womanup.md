My journey at WomanUp began with creating a mobile application in React Native ðŸ“±

From there, I expanded the project to include the entire infrastructureâ€”building serverless functions, databases, and handling data migrations 

Now, as a Tech Lead, I guide a talented team, ensuring they can deliver the best possible user experience. Watching the 
project evolve from a simple app into a complete ecosystem has been both rewarding and exciting, and leading the 
team through that process is the icing on the cake ðŸ’¡
