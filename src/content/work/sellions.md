At Sellions, I was responsible for developing a hybrid mobile application using the Ionic Framework, while also 
building a monolithic backend powered by Java and the Spring Framework üõ†Ô∏è 

A big part of my role involved processing large volumes of data with Spring Batch and creating custom tools to 
handle these challenges. It was like being a data wizard crafting solutions to manage big data in efficient and scalable ways. 

Each day brought new problems to solve, but with the right tools and teamwork, we always found a way to make the magic happen üßô‚Äç
